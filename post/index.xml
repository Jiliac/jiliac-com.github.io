      <title>Antifragile: Why AI fails and alternative</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;quick-summary&#34;&gt;Quick Summary&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all want to &lt;strong&gt;predict&lt;/strong&gt; the future. Once we know what will happen, we can
prepare and take advantage of the situation and become stronger. For example,
if you know which stock will go up/down, you would make a lot of money. The
ability to predict is the foundation of science: experiment to find
&lt;em&gt;models&lt;/em&gt; that can forecast the future.
Nassim Taleb destroyed this idea in his book &amp;ldquo;The Black Swan&amp;rdquo;: The most
impactful events, the game changers, are unpredictable. Although we often use
post-rationalization to make it look like we could have foreseen the events
after the fact. For example, the 9/11 attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &amp;ldquo;Antifragile: Things That Gain from Disorder&amp;rdquo;, Taleb explains what we can
do when we cannot predict the future but know it will change everything big
time. The answer is in the title: we should build &lt;strong&gt;antifragile&lt;/strong&gt; system.
We know there will be shocks. Instead of predicting these shocks themselves
and lowering their consequences, we make systems that take advantage of them!
Systems that get stronger thanks to the shocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;personal-impact&#34;&gt;Personal Impact&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taleb directly speaks to me. While working doing research on

&lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/publication/ankou/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Ankou&lt;/a&gt; and

&lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/publication/entropic/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Entropic&lt;/a&gt;, I often confronted
with this idea of how to deal with extremely rare events. In 2019, I got
passionate about &amp;ldquo;Complex System&amp;rdquo; theory: system with so many inner
interactions that their behavior cannot be well understood. I tried to read as
much as possible on the subject: Geoffrey West, John Holland, Stuart Kauffman,
and some others. I tried to understand &amp;ldquo;what can we do in this situation&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, we cannot use the usual scientific approach of decomposing systems
and then scaling up this understanding to predict the behavior of the whole
system. Complex systems can only be characterized with high level statistical
descriptors like &lt;em&gt;entropy&lt;/em&gt;. We are limited to description, we cannot predict.
And Taleb&amp;rsquo;s insight is a similar one: Complex systems, due to their many
interactions have hidden, unforeseeable and non-linear behaviors. Their
&lt;strong&gt;causal opacity&lt;/strong&gt; and non-linearity make them perfect &lt;strong&gt;Black Swan
generators&lt;/strong&gt;. And guess what, almost everything we deal with nowadays is
complex systems, are socio-economical system, most of the product we engineer
(that&amp;rsquo;s why we can&amp;rsquo;t seem to solve all bugs), and of course nature itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;solution&#34;&gt;Solution&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should stop trying to be smart. Stop trying to predict how systems are
going to react to this or that shock. We should go back to our real goal:
the &lt;strong&gt;payoff&lt;/strong&gt;. Focus back on what we get in the end. If we put ourselves in
an antifragile situation, we can benefit from future shocks, but we do not
need to plan for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-importance-of-options&#34;&gt;The Importance of Options&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Optionality is a substitute for intelligence.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The option is an agent of antifragility.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how do we make ourselves antifragile? We give ourselves &lt;strong&gt;options&lt;/strong&gt;. We
often try to cut all which seems unnecessary, or redundant, to perform better
at some given metric. But maybe this metric won&amp;rsquo;t be so important tomorrow.
By having options, you give yourself more paths to explore in the future when
you&amp;rsquo;ll get more information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taleb likes to use the &amp;ldquo;rational flâneur&amp;rdquo; metaphor: when you travel, instead
of having a two week plan of how you&amp;rsquo;ll visit this city or this country, you
just plan a few days forward. This way you have the freedom to plan the rest
of the trip when you acquire more information while you are already there.
You don&amp;rsquo;t know what kind of information you will acquire, you don&amp;rsquo;t know what
unexpected event can occur. By keeping a maximum of options available, you
make sure that whatever happens, you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to transform to your benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This &amp;ldquo;option&amp;rdquo; solution can be reformulated in a &amp;lsquo;&lt;strong&gt;Trial and error&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rsquo; policy.
All the things you can try are your options. Notice that you still need some
rationality to try options that have some potential, and then recognize a
successful trial. Taleb is saying that we rely too much on models and
top-down logic, but not that science and formalization are never useful. We
still need some. Just much less of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in the end, this is exactly the &lt;em&gt;evolutionary heuristics&lt;/em&gt; we use for
fuzzers! Each seed is an option the fuzzer has. The fitness function is the
way we chose the potential &amp;ldquo;good options&amp;rdquo; for the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;via-negativa&#34;&gt;Via Negativa&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Rule No. 1: Never lose money. Rule No. 2: Don’t forget rule No. 1&amp;rdquo;
Warren Buffet&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other way Taleb suggests to achieve antifragility is to &amp;ldquo;remove the bad
stuff&amp;rdquo;. It is not easy to predict what is going to happen, and it may be even
harder to take advantage of it. However, it is often quite simple to
&lt;strong&gt;detect fragility&lt;/strong&gt;. The via negativa way is: detect the bad and remove it.
This you are left with either robust, meaning that it does not have much
reaction to shocks, negatively or positively, or antifragile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We know a lot more about what is wrong than what is right. Negative
knowledge is more robust to error than positive knowledge.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what he calls the &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;barbell&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo; strategy. You have the robust part
which you can&amp;rsquo;t lose; it is your insurance. And you have the antifragile
part, which is riskier, but gives you exposure to different kinds of shocks
by being diversified, and makes your profit/payoff. This is not very
sophisticated, but in the end, &lt;strong&gt;less is more&lt;/strong&gt;. This technique was lightly
sketched out in &amp;ldquo;The Black Swan&amp;rdquo;, but without all of the fragility framework,
so it was hard to understand why it would work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not be a fool. Do not over-optimize your system thinking you got
everything under control. With a thin margin of safety, you risk losing it all.
You are never fully safe from a Black Swan unless you set your system up this
way.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Compiling Linux Kernel with Clang</title>
      <link>/post/kernel_clang_compile/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 13 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>/post/kernel_clang_compile/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone. This is my first &amp;lsquo;technical&amp;rsquo; blog post. I saw some people saying it
helps growing your explanation skills which I sincerely lack. Thus, I decided
next I struggle doing something because I feel it&amp;rsquo;s quite undocumented, I&amp;rsquo;ll try
to make a post and explain how I did it. If even one person reads this and it&amp;rsquo;s
even remotely useful to them, I&amp;rsquo;ll consider the job done. Ask any question, I&amp;rsquo;ll
be happy to answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now down to the topic. I have trying to compile the kernel with clang ever since
I have seen the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://lwn.net/Articles/734071/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;LWN.net article&lt;/a&gt; on the
topic. It says that you &amp;lsquo;just&amp;rsquo; need to go and compile your kernel with &lt;code&gt;make CC=clang&lt;/code&gt;. So I went into the linux sources I had at this time (something around
4.9.60) and type the command. Obviously it didn&amp;rsquo;t work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out, it&amp;rsquo;s not that much complicated. There are two requirements to
compiling your kernel with clang:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get the right source and configuration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get the right version of clang.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything is very well summarized on a LKML post from last November:
&lt;a href=&#34;https://lkml.org/lkml/2017/11/22/943&#34;&gt;https://lkml.org/lkml/2017/11/22/943&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concerning the source, I went for the simplest path: getting the latest stable
version of the kernel with default configuration:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-stable.git
cd linux-stable
git checkout v4.14.15
make defconfig
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here I&amp;rsquo;m on x86. If you want to compile for ARM64, it seems a bit more
complicated. I didn&amp;rsquo;t try it but you might want to look for the android source
that have not been upstreamed yet. Posting here because it&amp;rsquo;s not linked in the
Matthias Kaehlcke&amp;rsquo;s LKML post:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://android.googlesource.com/kernel/common.git/+log/android-4.9&#34;&gt;https://android.googlesource.com/kernel/common.git/+log/android-4.9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://android.googlesource.com/kernel/common.git/+log/android-4.4&#34;&gt;https://android.googlesource.com/kernel/common.git/+log/android-4.4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There also other documentation made by Google 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://apt.llvm.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;
which shows how to compile the kernel with KASAN and KCOV. Didn&amp;rsquo;t dig into that
but could be useful to someone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are looking for other configuration than just the default one, I didn&amp;rsquo;t
try that and I think it&amp;rsquo;s really and a case by case basis. You are going to have
to dig a little bit more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And for the version of clang, you need clang 5 or more. I on Debian Stretch for
which LLVM has precompiled binary (see here if you are on another OS version).
So add them to your source list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;sudo vim /etc/apt/sources.list 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then add:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;deb http://apt.llvm.org/stretch/ llvm-toolchain-stretch-6.0 main
deb-src http://apt.llvm.org/stretch/ llvm-toolchain-stretch-6.0 main
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you can install clang:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install clang-6.0
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are not on Debian/Ubuntu, I am not sure whether or not there is another
solution than just compiling LLVM directly (see 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://clang.llvm.org/get_started.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we have the source and the compiler, so we are ready to compile. Go in
your linux-stable/ folder and:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;make CC=clang-6.0 -j4 bzImage
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just wanted the &lt;code&gt;bzImage&lt;/code&gt; to boot, but you remove it if you want to compile
everything.
&lt;code&gt;-j4&lt;/code&gt; because gain time by making compilation parallel&amp;hellip; Now I don&amp;rsquo;t know how you
plan to use your clang compiled kernel, but just to check it&amp;rsquo;s usable, I run it
with qemu:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;qemu-system-x86_64 -kernel arch/x86/boot/bzImage -nographic -serial mon:stdio -append &#39;console=ttyS0&#39;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And since we didn&amp;rsquo;t provide the -initrd option, it will crash at the end with
something like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;---[ end Kernel panic - not syncing: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on unknown-block(0,0)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of guides on how to use your kernel, not the goal here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That will conclude my first post. Hopefully it was clear enough. Don&amp;rsquo;t hesitate
to contact me by any mean if you have any question or problems.&lt;/p&gt;
