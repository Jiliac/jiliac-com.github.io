    <div class="text-justify article-style">
      <h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>This is a summary of &ldquo;How to Win Friends and Influence People&rdquo; by Dale
Carnegie.
The goal of this book is obviously stated through its title
😜. Although at first sight, you might believe
this is achieved by tricking others, actually the basic answer is very
simple: just give your <strong>honest appreciation</strong> to others. See the world with
their eyes, <strong>understand</strong> them, and sincerely try to help them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The principles taught in this book will work only when they come from the
heart. I am not advocating a bag of tricks. I am talking about a new way of
life.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, even though this is simple in principle, it is quite far from our
first instinct. We tend to focus on ourselves, and me the first. So here I
want to make a kind checklist from the book 📃. This way anyone
can quickly go through it regularly and be sure to always have it fresh in
their mind. I would still recommend reading the book if you haven&rsquo;t done it yet.
It will be easier to get in Carnegie&rsquo;s mindset this way.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="the-fundamentals">The Fundamentals</h1>
<p>In this first part, Carnegie explains the base principles to apply. Then in
the following parts, the author gives more specific and directly applicable
advice.</p>
<h3 id="1-never-criticize">1. Never Criticize</h3>
<p>While criticizing, you run into the risk of turning people against yourself,
for the improbable upside of getting them to do what you want. It rarely
works and is very likely to backfire on you.</p>
<h3 id="2-praise-people">2. <em>Praise</em> People</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I consider my ability to arouse <strong>enthusiasm</strong> among my people the
greatest asset I possess, and the way to develop the best that is in a person
is by <strong>appreciation</strong> and encouragement. [&hellip;] I believe in giving
<strong>incentives</strong> to work.&rdquo; Charles Schwab</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For most people, a priority in life is to <strong>feel important</strong>. By providing
them with this feeling, you give them a reason to do what you want. Just give
them your honest appreciation for their own personnality or their action and
they will feel their importance.</p>
<h3 id="3-arouse-an-eager-want">3. Arouse an Eager Want</h3>
<p>No one cares about what <em>you</em> want. People care about their interests. To be
able to <strong>influence</strong> others, you need to <em>understand</em> what matters to them.
And once you identify their needs, show them how to get it. First,
arouse an eager want, then show them how to obtain it.</p>
<p>Example when in an apparent contradiction:</p>
<ol>
<li>Start positive.</li>
<li>But &hellip; describe the problem <strong>for them</strong>.</li>
<li>Explain a solution <strong>for them</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h1 id="make-people-love-you">Make People Love You</h1>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s get into the more practical advice.</p>
<h3 id="1-show-genuine-interest">1. Show Genuine Interest</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>A dog makes its living by giving nothing to you but <strong>love</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Basically, just show genuine love to others. It can be in little things, like
daily greetings. <strong>Do</strong> things for others, give them time, energy and
thoughtfulness. Before you realize it, they will have given it back to you.</p>
<p><em>Careful</em> though: always be sincere.</p>
<h3 id="2-smile">2. Smile</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>It costs nothing but creates much.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>You must have a good time meeting people if you expect them to have a good
time meeting you.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="3-call-people-by-name">3. Call People by <em>Name</em></h3>
<p>People place big importance on their own name. Remember it and call it
easily.</p>
<h3 id="4-be-an-active-listener">4. Be an <em>Active Listener</em></h3>
<p>Everyone wants an opportunity to expand their ego. So give them an
opportunity to do so by actively listening to them.
Be interested: Ask questions, encourage them to talk.</p>
<p>Letting people talk is a favor to them: it helps clarify their minds.</p>
<h3 id="5-find-and-talk-about-their-interest">5. Find and Talk about Their <em>Interest</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Talking in terms of the other person&rsquo;s interest pays off for both parties.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="6-make-others-feel-important">6. Make Others <em>Feel Important</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Every man I meet is my superior in some way. In that, I learn of him.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Honestly</strong> admire others. We all crave for importance.
Give to others what you would like to be given → To apply <strong>all the time</strong>!</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="change-people-thinking">Change People Thinking</h1>
<h3 id="1-you-cannot-win-an-argument">1. You Cannot Win an Argument</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>You can&rsquo;t win an argument. If you lose it, you lose it; If you win it, you
lose it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Arguing only creates <strong>resentment</strong>. The other person may do what you want,
but they won&rsquo;t do it with goodwill. They won&rsquo;t change their way of thinking.
Just <strong>never tell them they are wrong</strong>.
At least partially agree with them. Make them feel good. Promise to consider
their position. Show <strong>respect</strong> for their opinion.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you are going to prove anything, don&rsquo;t let anybody know it. Do it
subtly. [&hellip;] With a few low-keyed suggestions at proper intervals, I let them
develop my system themselves.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="2-willfully-admit-when-you-are-wrong">2. Willfully <em>Admit</em> when you are Wrong</h3>
<p>It is also quite likely that you are wrong. It happens surprisingly often.
And when we catch ourselves, let&rsquo;s <strong>admit it quickly and with enthusiasm</strong>.
It will <em>surprise</em> others and put them in a non-fighting mindset.
Astonishingly, we may get more from them this way.</p>
<h3 id="3-begin-friendly">3. Begin <em>Friendly</em></h3>
<p>At the start of the conversation or presentation, start in a &ldquo;friendly mode&rdquo;.
It will put people in a positive mindset. They will be more inclined to see
the good side of what you say.</p>
<h3 id="4-the-yes-yes-technique">4. The &ldquo;Yes, yes&rdquo; Technique</h3>
<p>Famously used by Socrates: He often began conversation emphasizing the thing
which he knew the other person will agree with. Seeking others agreement with
a question, forces to <em>commit</em> to your side. It creates a good atmosphere and
makes it easier for them to accept new ideas.</p>
<h3 id="5-let-others-talk">5. Let Others Talk</h3>
<p>This will make sure you <strong>understand</strong> them. If you talk too much and do not
give the others enough opportunity to express themselves, you might get into
the wrong argument which may not matter to them. Just restrain yourself to an
<em>active listener</em> position.</p>
<p>Even better, if you are subtle enough to guide them in their talk, you can
make <em>suggestions</em> and give them the <strong>feeling of ownership of ideas</strong> that
you provide them. Once they feel it is their idea, they will become their
strong supporter.</p>
<h3 id="6-understand-others-point-of-view">6. <em>Understand</em> Others Point of View</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Do not condemn them. Any fool can do that. Try to understand them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is really the key to this book. Try to see things as others experience
them. This is the best way to find how to change their mind.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cooperativeness in conversation is achieved when you show that you consider
the other person&rsquo;s ideas and feelings as <strong>important</strong> as your own.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Everyone craves for the sympathy of other people. Be <strong>sympathetic</strong> to their
ideas. Welcome them with an open mind.</p>
<h3 id="7-appeal-to-nobler-motives">7. Appeal to <em>Nobler Motives</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;A person usually has two reasons for doing something: one that sounds
good, and a real one&rdquo; J.P. Morgan</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you want to change people, appeal to their <strong>nobler</strong> motives. People are
honest and fair, or at least they want to feel so.</p>
<h3 id="8-dramatize-use-showmanship">8. <em>Dramatize</em>, use Showmanship</h3>
<p>It makes your idea more <strong>vivid</strong>. It makes abstractions more concrete and
thus easier to grasp. Numbers or concepts do not stick.</p>
<h3 id="9-challenge-people">9. <em>Challenge</em> People</h3>
<p>Carnegie advices using this when nothing else works. Stimulating competition,
challenging people will <strong>drive their desire to excel</strong>. In the end, we are
all motivated to do the best we can in the task we achieve.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="being-a-leader">Being A Leader</h1>
<p>How to change people without offending them or causing resentment?</p>
<h3 id="1-always-begin-with-praise">1. Always Begin with <em>Praise</em></h3>
<p>Only critic after you praise. You will set yourself as a friendly
figure and thus your point will be received with a more positive mind.</p>
<h3 id="2-praise-the-slight-improvement">2. Praise the Slight Improvement</h3>
<p>Praise as the power to <strong>inspire</strong> people to go beyond what they thought they
could do. The more you use this power, the more they will feel encouraged.</p>
<p>Be <em>specific</em> in your praise. It shows the other you are really sincere. Your
words are not empty, they have substance because you can precisely point what
is praiseworthy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When criticism is minimized and praise emphasized, the good things people
do will be reinforced, and the poorer things will atrophy for lack of
attention.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="3-fake-it-till-they-make-it">3. Fake It Till <em>They</em> Make It</h3>
<p>If you show you believe someone has a virtue, state it openly, they will want
to live up to the reputation you have given them! It will motivate them, give
them a challenge.</p>
<p>Plus, whenever they make mistakes, minimize it. Make it look like a small
thing, like something <strong>easy to overcome</strong>. They may discover something they
thought was hard, it actually easy for them once you give them the strength
to <strong>go beyond their limits</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="4-criticize-indirectly">4. Criticize Indirectly</h3>
<p>This one is harder to grasp. Basically, if you point mistakes directly,
people may resent you. Instead, only suggest it indirectly. Make the other
person understand your point by going around it. The danger is that you
wander off too far from your target and that they do not see the point you
critic at all.</p>
<p>An example from the book I found quite helpful: A guy wrote a speech and asks
the opinion of his wife on it. The speech was quite bad because it would not
flow well as a spoken performance. Instead of directly saying so, his wife
said that it would make an excellent article. Praising it while making it
clear that it would be a boring speech.</p>
<h3 id="5-start-by-stating-your-mistakes">5. Start by Stating <em>Your Mistakes</em></h3>
<p>We have seen several <em>starting tips</em> so far. The way you start is
important, it sets the mood. It can open or close the mind of the other
person. So if you begin talking by criticizing yourself, you communicate to
the other that you are a fair and humble person. You are not a distant boss
too full of himself.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It isn&rsquo;t nearly so difficult to listen to a recital of your faults if the
person criticizing begins by humbly admitting that he, <em>too</em>, is far from
impeccable.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="6-the-power-of-suggestions">6. The Power of <em>Suggestions</em></h3>
<p>No one likes to receive orders. So instead, try to only suggest a way of
doing. Ask them questions that only hint at what you think would be a good
way of proceeding. People will be much happier doing things if they feel it
is <em>their decision</em>. Or at least that they are involved in the decision
process.</p>
<p>Plus, always try to <em>understand</em> what <em>benefits them</em>. Why would they be
happy of following your suggestions? How would it benefit them? Sincerely try
to match what would be a good outcome for them with what you want
to be accomplished. This way, others may be <strong>happy of doing what you
suggest</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="7-let-others-save-face">7. Let Others <em>Save Face</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>I have no right to say or do anything that diminishes a man in his own
eyes. What matters is not what I think of him, but what he thinks of himself.
Hurting a man dignity is a crime.&rdquo; Antoine de Saint-Exupéry.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you destroy other people&rsquo;s ego, they will always resent you and never
follow you.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>All these points are simple one by one. But all together they create a
system of communication which doesn&rsquo;t come easily. It&rsquo;s important to
<strong>practice</strong> it as much as possible. In all our interactions. And there are
many recommendations, so it&rsquo;s hard to keep them all in mind. So come back to
this list regularly to refresh your mind 😉.</p>
