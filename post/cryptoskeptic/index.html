      <p>Look inside: What’s the promise of the blockchain you believe in? That it will change the world? Or that it will make you rich?</p>
<p>They are not the same thing.</p>
<p>Bitcoin is the first internet-native way to speculate.</p>
<p>The technology could become omnipresent while the first crypto-currency becomes irrelevant.</p>
<p>To succeed a technology needs more than a vertical chart.</p>
<p><img width="600px" src="/img/cryptoskeptic/bitcoin_price.png"
alt="Bitcoin to the moon!"></p>
<p><strong>To drive widespread adoption, a technology needs to be useful, to solve a problem.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A car has a clear benefit. You move. Fast.</li>
<li>Steam enabled mechanization of production.</li>
<li>With internet I can communicate with anyone, anywhere.</li>
</ul>
<p>What can I do with a Bitcoin?</p>
<p>I first heard of the blockchain in 2013. Until this summer (2021), I didn’t believe it had any chance of becoming useful.</p>
<p>Siding out central banks may be exciting for hard core libertarian. But it’s not going to cut it for most people.</p>
<p>The true reason 
<a href="https://www.binance.com/en/blog/markets/the-world-goes-crypto-top-5-countries-adopting-crypto-and-how-busd-helps-421499824684902531" target="_blank" rel="noopener">300 millions people invested in cryptos</a> isn’t the ideology.</p>
<p><strong>It’s the quick buck</strong> 💸</p>
<p>No one can deny that Bitcoin failed on its initial promise. It did not become a “coin”, an internet-native currency.</p>
<p>As all good marketers do, the fanboys changed the claim.</p>
<p>“Oh it was never about making a currency. Bitcoin is a store of value. An internet-native gold.”</p>
<p>Except gold doesn’t lose 50% of its value every other week.</p>
<p><img width="600px" src="/img/cryptoskeptic/bitcoin_gold.png"
alt="Gold vs Bitcoin"></p>
<p>(Source: 
<a href="https://aswathdamodaran.blogspot.com/2020/11/a-viral-market-update-xiv-wrap-on-covid.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Aswath Damodaran</a>. Bitcoin didn’t achieve gold stability.)</p>
<h2 id="the-tipping-point">⛰️ The Tipping Point</h2>
<p>Still. All the media noise around 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NFTs</a> and 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Web3</a> tipped me over.</p>
<p>After looking into it, I finally believed there may be something to this chain of block thing.</p>
<p>What’s so special about it?</p>
<p>Let’s start with NFTs and come back to Web3 later.</p>
<p>At first, you could say NFTs just pulled the same trick as crypto-currencies: Being another channel for rollercoaster speculation.</p>
<p>But let’s go deeper.</p>
<p>NFTs have the potential to support the creator economy (artists, writers, podcasters, youtubers&hellip;).</p>
<p>And more than enabling the purchase of their creation, an <strong>NFT could give its holder <em>rights</em></strong>.</p>
<p>Where Bitcoin is blocked into being a commodity, NFTs have unlimited flexibility in the rights they can give.</p>
<p>An NFT could represent the right to meet its creator in 1-1s, or the right to attend his events (i.e., tickets), or the right to vote/participate in the next creation.</p>
<p>I admit it is still fuzzy what the ownership of an NFT could represent, but this flexibility opens the door to USEFULNESS.</p>
<p>For example, 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorare" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sorare</a> uses NFTs to create a collectible card game where cards are tradeable.</p>
<h2 id="bubble-economy">🎈 Bubble Economy</h2>
<p>At the moment, the area is awash with capital. All sorts of projects get funded.</p>
<p>If you look at any of the major technology developments in the past, there has always been a <em>frenzy</em> of funding at first.</p>
<p>Be it in the steam age, the railways, or in IT, at the start, there is a bubble.</p>
<p><img width="600px" src="/img/cryptoskeptic/new_tech_frenzy.png"
alt="Frenzy of new technology"></p>
<p>(From “Technological Revolution and Financial Capital” by Carlota Perez.)</p>
<p>The dawn of AI was predicted in the 1970s but only happened in 2010.</p>
<p>
<a href="https://tim.blog/2021/10/28/chris-dixon-naval-ravikant/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Even crypto experts</a> agree there is no doubt there is a bubble around crypto-assets.</p>
<p>People telling you with 100% certainty that blockchain is the future are lying. Either to you or to themselves.</p>
<p>We can only be certain of the blockchain usefulness once it is widely adopted.</p>
<p>For now, we are at the start and we can only hope to catch a glimpse of the future.</p>
<p>/rant_end</p>
<h2 id="the-glimpse">👀 The Glimpse</h2>
<p>NFTs were the appetizer.</p>
<p>It’s the main course that converted me: Web3.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>”Web3 is the internet owned by the builders and users, orchestrated with tokens.”</em> — Chris Dixon</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To me, the magic happens at the “orchestrated with token”.</p>
<ul>
<li>Orchestrated means governed or administrated.</li>
<li>A token is a right. (As with NFTs, since they are also token, only non-fungible.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Blurry. But this opens the door for a new kind of social organization.</p>
<p>For now this takes the form of 
<a href="https://hackernoon.com/what-is-a-dao-c7e84aa1bd69" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Decentralized Autonomous Organizations</a> (DAO)
<a href="https://hackernoon.com/what-is-a-dao-c7e84aa1bd69" target="_blank" rel="noopener">.</a></p>
<p>For example, last November, ConstitutionDAO was formed in a few days to buy one of the 13 original United States Constitution copies.</p>
<p>They raised $43 millions from 17,437 contributors in 72h.</p>
<p>But Kickstarter could have done the same, no?</p>
<p>They have the technology to do so. But a single project never even raised half this amount.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p><strong>TRUST.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>”Trust minimization is reducing the vulnerability of participants to each other’s and to outsiders’ and intermediaries potential for harmful behavior.”</em> — 
<a href="https://unenumerated.blogspot.com/2017/02/money-blockchains-and-social-scalability.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nick Szabo</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>From the beginning the main strength of the protocol invented by 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoshi_Nakamoto" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Satoshi Nakamoto</a> is the little to no trust you need to have trust in the other participants to engage with it.</p>
<p>You don’t need to trust the people, the group or its leaders.</p>
<p>You just need to trust the code.</p>
<p>In my life I signed 1000s of contracts which I didn’t read. Because the contracts are just an insurance for worst case scenarios.</p>
<p>In truth, when you sign a contract you trust the people.</p>
<p>With a 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_contract" target="_blank" rel="noopener">smart contract</a> on the blockchain, it’s different. It defines the mode of interaction with this project.</p>
<p>The members of ConstitutionDAO knew their money could only be used to buy the constitution. They knew they’d be able to vote on what would be done with it afterwards.</p>
<p>The seller, 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sotheby%27s" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sotheby’s</a>, knew it could trust this organization (which didn’t exist the week before) to afford its bid.</p>
<p>Unlike usual contracts, you don’t even need to trust the State to enforce your contract.</p>
<p>The smart contract self-enforce. You don’t need to do anything for it to execute (and you couldn’t stop it if you wanted to).</p>
<p>In the real world, contracts are never self-enforced. You need lawyers. Which are&hellip;</p>
<p>Not free. Both in terms of money and time.</p>
<p>Time is key.</p>
<h2 id="what-humans-do-best">👬 What Humans Do Best</h2>
<p>Why do humans dominate all other species?</p>
<p>Our cognitive capacity?</p>
<p>You may be ever so smart. But alone you are nothing.</p>
<p><strong>The key difference: We are social. We make groups and coordinate.</strong></p>
<p>These groups grow to towns, cities and nations.</p>
<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_Nations_Fail" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“Why Nations Fail?”</a></p>
<p>In their book, Acemoglu and Robinson have a clear answer: Because nations don’t have <em>inclusive</em> enough institutions.</p>
<p>People are not able to participate in their own governance.</p>
<p>This is not an article about democracy so I won’t expand much longer on this.</p>
<p>All our democracies and 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_contract" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our social contracts</a> did not evolve for nearly a century.</p>
<p>The law is too slow, too costly. We have a single vote between two different options every other year.</p>
<p>The world is too complex for this to be enough. We need a new way to interact with each other.</p>
<p>To take group decisions.</p>
<p>Finding new modes of social organization is an even more important challenge than surviving climate change in my opinion.</p>
<p><strong>I think the blockchain is the technology that can enable the <em>social innovations</em> we need to level up human organizations.</strong></p>
<p>Fast experiments are the enabler of discoveries.</p>
<p>The blockchain is the technology unlocking this speed by lowering the trust requirement for social organizations.</p>
<p>I know this is only a glimpse 🔭</p>
<p>But it’s enough to get me excited in the field and speculate on its success.</p>
<p>I speculate with the most valuable resource I have: time.</p>
