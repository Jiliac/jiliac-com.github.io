This week: technical progress, content creation infrastructure, and a strategic market pivot.\nTechnical Progress: Building the Data Pipeline Last week\u0026rsquo;s experiments made it clear I needed better data from my solver to create meaningful content. So I built a comprehensive evaluation function:\ntype EvalReport struct { ActionEVs []float32 // Expected value for each possible action Equity float32 // Current hand equity EQRs []float32 // Equity realization by action AvgPolicy []float64 // Solver's recommended action frequencies AvgEquity float32 // Average equity across opponent range }  This gives me everything needed to explain why a play is optimal, not just what to do. I wrote a script that runs this for every decision point in a hand, creating a complete strategic narrative.\nThe Bottleneck Here\u0026rsquo;s where past shortcuts caught up with me. Generating game states by sampling from subgames is painfully slow. Why? A month ago, I took a shortcut in how I handle range distributions. Instead of maintaining explicit range objects with hand probabilities, I used a simpler approach that now makes sampling computationally expensive.\nThe fix is straightforward ‚Äì properly maintain range objects throughout the calculation. But it means rewriting a chunk of the solver infrastructure. For now, turn and river analysis is essentially broken, limiting me to flop-only content.\nI decided to defer this fix. Why spend days on technical debt when I still need to validate whether anyone wants this product?\nContent Creation Engine: From Data to Articles Instead of perfecting the solver, I built a content generation pipeline:\n Data Generation: Run EvalHand for each decision point AI Analysis: Feed each situation to an LLM for strategic interpretation Outline Creation: Combine solver data + manual context ‚Üí LLM creates article outline Human Review: I review and adjust the outline Draft Generation: LLM writes the first draft Final Edit: Human polish and fact-checking  The process works. I published two deep-dive analyses:\n  Montenegro\u0026rsquo;s $444k pot breakdown  $100k pocket tens analysis  Images are still manual (screenshots, generated images), and there\u0026rsquo;s an annoying OpenGraph bug to fix, but the core pipeline produces solid content. Each piece takes about 2-3 hours from data to published article.\nStrategic Market Pivot: Narrowing Focus This week forced a reality check on my market ambitions.\nOriginal vision: Target US/global cash games ‚Äì the biggest poker market. These games typically run 7-9 players with varying stack sizes.\nThe problems:\n My solver only handles 5-max games I don\u0026rsquo;t actually play these formats (French platforms are segregated) Technical complexity scales exponentially with more players I\u0026rsquo;m building for a market I don\u0026rsquo;t understand  New direction: French 3-player Spin \u0026amp; Go tournaments.\nYes, it\u0026rsquo;s a smaller market. But consider:\n 3 players instead of 9 (dramatically simpler to solve) Short stacks (less strategic complexity) Most popular format in France I actually play this format daily  This feels like a retreat, but it\u0026rsquo;s strategic. Better to build something that works for a market I understand than to fail chasing a larger opportunity.\nThe \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;ll Expand Later\u0026rdquo; Trap I\u0026rsquo;m aware of the risk. Countless startups say \u0026ldquo;we\u0026rsquo;ll expand later\u0026rdquo; and become trapped in their initial niche. Their product-market fit becomes so specific that expansion requires starting over.\nBut poker might be different. The core challenge isn\u0026rsquo;t teaching French players different rules ‚Äì it\u0026rsquo;s getting anyone to trust AI coaching. If I can prove French players will take strategic advice from an AI, that psychological validation should transfer across markets. The technical details (game formats, stack sizes) are engineering problems. Trust is the real barrier.\nNext Focus: TikTok Experimentation The blog posts are live but not promoted ‚Äì they\u0026rsquo;re raw material for the next experiment. This week I\u0026rsquo;m pivoting to TikTok content creation. Poker strategy performs well in short-form video, and it\u0026rsquo;s where my target audience actually spends time.\nThe plan: Transform blog analyses into bite-sized video content. Test what resonates. Learn what hooks work. Then scale what succeeds.\nLooking Ahead Week 2 taught me to embrace constraints. My solver can\u0026rsquo;t handle everything, so I\u0026rsquo;ll focus on what it can. The global market is too broad, so I\u0026rsquo;ll start with France. Perfect technical solutions can wait until after market validation.\nNext week: Results from TikTok experiments and the eternal question ‚Äì when do I fix that sampling bug?\n What would you build for your local market first? Let me know on Twitter or Discord.\n","date":1750032000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1750032000,"objectID":"ebad8d3b57f4f3fa732ec3dee9df682b","permalink":"/devlog/2/","publishdate":"2025-06-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/devlog/2/","section":"devlog","summary":"Building AskPoker.ai week 2: Created a content engine with AI + solver data, pivoting to French Spin \u0026 Go market, and launching TikTok experiments.","tags":null,"title":"AskPoker.ai Dev Log #2: Building a Content Engine and Finding My Market","type":"devlog"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"AskPoker.ai Week 1: Reality Check and Pivot to Concierge MVP This week I learned some hard truths about my assumptions building AskPoker.ai. Time for radical honesty about what\u0026rsquo;s working and what isn\u0026rsquo;t.\nFor context, AskPoker.ai is my attempt to build a conversational AI poker coach that gives recreational players instant, solver-backed analysis of their hands. Instead of wrestling with complex software like PioSOLVER, players can just describe their hand in plain English and get clear strategic advice. I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on this for about 6 months, and this is my first public update on the journey. You can read more about the original vision in my announcement post.\nWhat I Tried: Forum Engagement Experiment My plan was simple: test demand by answering poker hands on Reddit and 2+2 with AskPoker analysis. Use the tool to generate insights, then sign responses with \u0026ldquo;made with askpoker.ai\u0026rdquo; to see if people were interested in the platform.\nThe goal was to validate the core value proposition while driving some early traffic. What I found instead was a masterclass in why assumptions need real-world testing.\nHard Truths Discovered 1. The Product Isn\u0026rsquo;t Ready Table size limitation: My backend solver only handles 5-max tables, not the 6+ player tables common in most online games. When users post hands from full ring games, the solver has no data, so the LLM just improvises answers based on general poker knowledge.\nI knew this was a constraint going in, but experiencing it in practice hit different. I now understand I must solve this limitation eventually (though interestingly, in the French market where 5-max cash games dominate, this might not be as critical).\nScope mismatch: I built the tool to analyze single decisions (\u0026ldquo;Should I call this river bet?\u0026quot;), but users want comprehensive hand reviews. They want to know where their decisions went wrong across multiple streets, not just get advice on one spot.\nInsufficient backend data: The solver gives me the optimal action, but lacks the rich context needed for proper explanations - full ranges, equity calculations, expected value, fold equity. Without this data, the LLM fills in gaps with educated guesses that sometimes sound confident but are wrong.\nBasic bugs: Simple things like currency-to-blind conversion. I expected the LLM to handle this automatically when calling the backend, but it doesn\u0026rsquo;t.\n2. Market Reality Check Forum fragmentation: Even active communities like 2+2 and Reddit aren\u0026rsquo;t exactly buzzing with activity. There\u0026rsquo;s discussion, but it\u0026rsquo;s not the vibrant marketplace of poker questions I had imagined.\nFrench market gap: I found essentially no active French poker discussion platforms. This surprised me - I expected at least some local communities.\nUser behavior insight: Players consume more content (YouTube, training sites) than they engage in forum discussions. This suggests my marketing approach needs to meet users where they actually spend time, not where I assumed they\u0026rsquo;d be.\n3. The Concierge MVP Reality Check Here\u0026rsquo;s where brutal honesty matters: my initial assessment was too rosy.\nActual results: About 75% of my responses were ignored, ~15% got genuine positive responses from users (actual replies thanking me for the analysis), and ~10% were called out for containing errors where the LLM had hallucinated explanations.\nReddit truth: People might not always give positive feedback when you help them, but they never let wrong analysis slide. Every mistake gets caught and corrected, often harshly.\nKey insight: Demand absolutely exists for expert-level analysis in accessible language, but the quality bar is unforgiving. There\u0026rsquo;s no room for \u0026ldquo;pretty good\u0026rdquo; when giving strategic advice.\nThe Pivot: From Product to Process Why Concierge MVP Makes Sense The product is too broken for self-service user testing, but the manual approach validates something crucial: the core value proposition works when executed correctly.\nMore importantly, I need to answer a fundamental question: Are recreational players ready to trust an AI coach? This is about more than just technical capability - it\u0026rsquo;s about user psychology and market readiness.\nWhile I\u0026rsquo;m confident I can solve the technical issues given enough time, creating trust is a different challenge entirely. This requires marketing and communication skills that aren\u0026rsquo;t in my natural wheelhouse, making validation even more critical.\nMy new process: users message me via email or Discord for hand analysis. I use the backend tool to generate insights, then manually refine and explain the analysis. This creates a controlled environment to test whether players accept AI-driven coaching when it\u0026rsquo;s delivered thoughtfully.\nNew Strategy: Content-Led Growth Blog foundation: Generate poker-specific content using the LLM+solver combination. This content becomes source material for TikTok scripts and other marketing efforts - creating a scalable content system.\nTikTok expansion: Meet users where they actually are, not in forums. Poker content performs well on TikTok, and the format suits quick hand analysis and strategy tips.\nNovel LLM usage: This isn\u0026rsquo;t just automating existing tasks - I\u0026rsquo;m using AI as both an exploration agent (to probe solver outputs) and as a writer (to explain complex concepts clearly). This combination creates content capabilities that didn\u0026rsquo;t exist before.\nTransparent AI positioning: Brand myself as \u0026ldquo;Human + AI\u0026rdquo; poker analysis. Be upfront about using AI tools while emphasizing human judgment and experience.\nTechnical Priorities (Despite \u0026ldquo;No Product Development\u0026rdquo;) I said I\u0026rsquo;d stop building features, but I need to fix the solver-LLM pipeline to eliminate hallucinations. The focus shifts from user-facing features to content creation tools:\n Fix solver data output to provide complete strategic context Build reliable solver-LLM pipeline for scalable content creation Develop the infrastructure needed for consistent, accurate analysis  What\u0026rsquo;s Next Weekly devlogs: Continue documenting discoveries and pivots transparently.\nManual hand analysis: Build audience and expertise through direct engagement while testing AI coach acceptance.\nContent system development: Create the infrastructure for scalable marketing through AI-assisted content creation.\nEventual transition: Move from concierge to automated product once the core experience is proven and technical limitations are resolved.\nClosing Reflection Sometimes the best product development is realizing when to stop developing and start validating. This week taught me that building in public means being honest about failures, not just successes.\nThe forum experiment didn\u0026rsquo;t go as planned, but it revealed something more valuable than validation: it showed me exactly what needs to be fixed and where my assumptions were wrong. That\u0026rsquo;s worth more than a hundred positive feedback comments on a fundamentally flawed approach.\nNext week: Testing how far I can push the LLM+solver integration to create a scalable marketing system.

But they\u0026rsquo;re missing the real opportunity.\nThe Great Misunderstanding Everyone\u0026rsquo;s building ChatGPT wrappers. Scroll through Product Hunt or Y Combinator\u0026rsquo;s latest batch and you\u0026rsquo;ll see the pattern: database queries become \u0026lsquo;natural language analytics,\u0026rsquo; search engines get chat interfaces, productivity tools gain conversational layers.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s 2007 all over again.\nWhen the iPhone launched, most people thought \u0026ldquo;it\u0026rsquo;s just a better phone with internet.\u0026rdquo; They completely missed that we were about to see entirely new application categories emerge‚ÄîUber, Instagram, Tinder. Apps that couldn\u0026rsquo;t exist before the smartphone, not because the technology wasn\u0026rsquo;t ready, but because the interaction paradigm wasn\u0026rsquo;t there.\nToday, we\u0026rsquo;re making the same mistake with LLMs (Large Language Models). We\u0026rsquo;re thinking too small.\nWhat LLMs Actually Enable The real opportunity isn\u0026rsquo;t making existing tools more conversational. It\u0026rsquo;s creating entirely new experiences that were never economically viable before:\n Personalized expertise at scale: AI that adapts to individual knowledge gaps and communication styles Context-aware coaching: Understanding not just what you\u0026rsquo;re asking, but why you\u0026rsquo;re confused Real-time learning: Immediate feedback loops for complex decisions  The pattern to look for isn\u0026rsquo;t \u0026ldquo;how do we make X more accessible?\u0026rdquo; It\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;what expertise bottlenecks can we eliminate entirely?\u0026rdquo;\nA Case Study in Missing the Point Let me show you what I mean with poker.\nProfessional poker players use tools called \u0026ldquo;solvers\u0026rdquo;‚Äîsophisticated algorithms that calculate mathematically optimal strategy. Think of them as the chess engines of poker. Tools like PioSOLVER and GTO Wizard can tell you the perfect play in any situation.\nBut they\u0026rsquo;re designed for experts. The interfaces look like this:\nMonthly subscriptions run ‚Ç¨100+. Setup requires technical knowledge. The learning curve is brutal. One forum user described trying to learn PioSOLVER as \u0026ldquo;requiring a fair amount of technical knowledge\u0026hellip; for a lot of players, it was a frustrating experience.\u0026rdquo;\nThe Obvious (Wrong) Solution Most people would see this and think: \u0026ldquo;Just put a chat interface on top of the solver!\u0026rdquo;\nTake GTO Wizard\u0026rsquo;s complex output, add a conversational wrapper, maybe simplify the display a bit. Same underlying complexity, slightly friendlier packaging.\nThis is exactly the kind of \u0026ldquo;AI wrapper\u0026rdquo; thinking that misses the real opportunity.\nThe Real Opportunity: Entirely New Experiences Instead of asking \u0026ldquo;how do we make solvers easier to use?\u0026rdquo; I asked \u0026ldquo;what coaching experiences were never possible before?\u0026rdquo;\nThat led me to build AskPoker.ai. Here\u0026rsquo;s what a session looks like:\nYou: \u0026ldquo;I raised pocket nines from middle position, got called by button and big blind. Flop came A-9-5 rainbow. I bet, button folded, big blind raised. Should I call or re-raise?\u0026rdquo;\nAskPoker: \u0026ldquo;You have a monster hand with middle set on this board. The BB\u0026rsquo;s min-raise could be a weaker ace trying to build the pot, two pair like A5 or A9, a draw like 67 or 78, or even a pure bluff with missed hands. Raising is better than calling for several key reasons\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nThis isn\u0026rsquo;t a better interface for existing tools. It\u0026rsquo;s a fundamentally new interaction that bridges expert algorithms with human communication patterns.\nWhy This Works The magic happens in the gap between computational power and human understanding:\n Natural expression: Describe hands like talking to a friend, not inputting technical parameters Instant expertise: Get solver-backed analysis without learning complex software Contextual explanations: AI adapts explanations to your level and explains the \u0026ldquo;why\u0026rdquo; Immediate feedback: Review confusing hands right after they happen  Early validation is promising. When I manually provide this kind of analysis on poker forums, users specifically thank me while ignoring other responses in the same threads. There\u0026rsquo;s real demand for this bridge between expert knowledge and accessible communication.\nThe Bigger Pattern Poker is just one example. The pattern applies anywhere you find:\n Complex domains where expertise is expensive and hard to access High-context decisions where generic advice isn\u0026rsquo;t enough Learning-oriented users who want to understand, not just get answers  Think legal strategy coaching for small firms. Medical decision support for patients navigating treatment options. Business strategy guidance for specific competitive situations.\nThese aren\u0026rsquo;t \u0026ldquo;better interfaces for existing tools.\u0026rdquo; They\u0026rsquo;re entirely new coaching experiences that eliminate expertise bottlenecks.\nThe Window Won\u0026rsquo;t Stay Open We\u0026rsquo;re still early. Most LLM applications remain glorified chatbots for existing workflows. But that\u0026rsquo;s changing fast.\nThe first movers who identify these expertise gaps and build new experiences around them will establish category-defining positions. Just like Uber didn\u0026rsquo;t win by making taxi companies more efficient‚Äîthey eliminated the taxi bottleneck entirely.\nTraditional solver companies face an innovator\u0026rsquo;s dilemma. Adding conversational AI would cannibalize their complex, high-priced products. But someone will build these bridges between expert systems and human understanding.\nWhat This Means for You The smartphone moment for LLMs isn\u0026rsquo;t about making everything conversational. It\u0026rsquo;s about enabling entirely new experiences that were never economically viable before.\nLook for expertise bottlenecks in domains you know well. Where do people struggle to access or apply complex knowledge? Where are the gaps between what algorithms can compute and what humans can understand?\nThose gaps are where the next generation of applications will emerge.\n Try the conversational expertise approach yourself at askpoker.ai, or join our Discord to explore similar opportunities in your domain.

Probably you have users, so setup authentication Get to the meat of your project  By the time I get to (5), I lost excitement. On my last project though, it felt different.\nAs the title gave away, this project was in the (so-called) web 3 space.\nüçî¬†Fast Dev Originally I had a lot of misgivings about the area. What can you do with a blockchain that you can‚Äôt do with a database? What value does it bring?\nIMO there is a 70% chance that this whole web 3 thing will be a flop. But if the other 30% comes to happen, it will be big. So it‚Äôs worth investing time to learn how it works.\nSo off I went on this first learning project. (Live at invisoo.com. I‚Äôll write another blog to talk more about the project and its design decisions.)\nHere is what starting this project looked like:\n Create basic front and smart contract Dockerize Get to the meat  First shortcut: a contract can serve as both your backend and your DB (i.e. execution and storage). You don‚Äôt need to deal with authentication because web 3 users come with an identity in the form of their wallet.\nüçïPiece of the Whole Throughout my development, I got the feeling of being able to leverage of ‚Äúbigger whole‚Äù. It starts with user/wallet handling but it goes on\u0026hellip;\nI felt the inter-connected of web 3 shined by how ubiquitous tokens are:\n Using Open Zeppelin you can easily customize a token implementation to your needs.  New tokens are supported by every wallet without any need for you to do anything.  Online transaction explorers will detect underlying token transfers.  Using tokens make your DApp ‚Äúpluggable‚Äù into an even bigger part of the ecosystem. For example, once you transfer a token to the user, he can use it with any other DApp. For example, he could go and trade it at Uniswap even though trading wasn‚Äôt in your original design.  (Tokens may not be your go-to design though. I also didn‚Äôt consider them at the beginning. I‚Äôll expand on why I modified the design of my project to use tokens in the next blog. I found the implementation easier this way.)\nTo expand on the third point, I found online transaction explorers mind-blowing.\nYou just deploy, you don‚Äôt have to do anything and you can visualize every interaction of a user with your contract. This is the benefit of operating on a transparent data layer.\nYou can easily see the current state of your contract, the users and also all the historical transactions that brought us to this state.\nü•¶¬†The Less Fun The thing I found buggy is the handling of chains. Which chain is the user connected to? The localhost chain? The test chain? The main chain (i.e. Ethereum).\nDepending on the chain the user is connected to, we need to rely on a different ‚Äúprovider‚Äù. The provider allows our front to read and write the blockchain. It‚Äôs sad that we have to rely on a centralized intermediary, but it‚Äôs necessary in a world where users don‚Äôt run and index the blockchain locally.\nAnother pain I felt while developing is doing math. By default smart contracts only handle integers. In the end, you can just import some library to solve this problem but it‚Äôs still messy.\nConclusion I‚Äôm still not sure what value Web 3 brings to the users, but at least I found it does bring value to developers.\nThe problems are small compared to the value provided by being part of a big ecosystem.\nOperating on a transparent data layer like the blockchain will not fit every design though. All data has to be public.\nWeb 3 people would say that‚Äôs not a bug but a feature üòõ\n","date":1655596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1655596800,"objectID":"0f5ea47e9fb1bdf42eb6e0884db178e1","permalink":"/post/blockchain-backend/","publishdate":"2022-06-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/blockchain-backend/","section":"post","summary":"What if we could stop wasting most of our development time re-developing the same thing again and again?","tags":null,"title":"The Blockchain will Replace your Backend","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"What this is about This is a basic programming showcase of VCs (read on to know what they are).\nThe code can be found on Github but I\u0026rsquo;ll share the most important snippet here.\nü§Ø VCs what? Verifiable credentials (VCs) are the translation of physical credentials like a driving license or a degree in the digital world.\nRelying on cryptographic proofs enables several advantages:\n Impossible to fake Scalable since digital (for all the actor involved) Enables minimum disclosure  This last point may be fuzzy because we never do it in the physical world. Let‚Äôs take an example.\nLet‚Äôs say you are asked to prove you are an adult.

There are three roles involve with any type of credential:\n The Issuer: creation of the credential The Subject: The credential is about them. They receive it, hold it and share it with the Verifiers. The Verifier: Receive and verify the proofs from Subjects.  Now let‚Äôs take a close (technical ü§ì) look at each of the role.\nPart I: The Issuance Let‚Äôs say the issuer is my university. I just graduated and I get issued a degree:\n{ \u0026quot;age\u0026quot;: 24, \u0026quot;universityName\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;Oxford\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;degree\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;Bachelor of Science\u0026quot; }  The above is the claim of the credential.\nOur next goal is to get the issuer to sign this claim. This signature will be the proof.\nTo do so, the issuer needs two things:\n To have a digital presence. Which is represented cryptographically by a public and private key. To know who is the subject.

They will usually be present in all VCs but for our first understanding of their usage, we can ignore them.\nIn this example, I‚Äôve chosen to put the public keys directly in the VC. The proof.creator and credentialSubject.id fields are respectively the public keys of the issuer and the subject.\nIn a real application, they would be a Decentralized Identifier (DID) which would point to the keys.\n A DID can resolve to multiple public keys A DID enable the rotation of these keys A DID can resolve to service endpoints  Note: If you look at the full code in the repo, you‚Äôll see that in the excerpt above I cheated twice üòõ. I hope you‚Äôll forgive these simplifications.\nPart II: The Presentation (by the Subject) Now that our subject has its degree, he can present it to an employer.\nYou may be thinking: well, in the real world, I just show my credential to the verifier and that‚Äôs it.\nExcept, there is this moment when you give your driving license to a police officer where he checks that your face looks like the photo on your ID. What is this check for?\n.\n.\nFound it? It‚Äôs to check that you are the real owner of the credential. The police officer wants to make sure you didn‚Äôt happen to give him a credential about someone else.\nHow does this step translate in the digital world?\nIt‚Äôs what we call the Presentation of the credential.\nTo make sure the subject presents a credential that is his, the verifier asks him to sign the credential.\nYou may think: we are coming back to the same problem. The subject could steal an old presentation and give it to the verifier.\nSo that‚Äôs why the verifier provides a ‚Äúchallenge‚Äù to the subject to include in its presentation. It ensures the presentation was done by the subject just for this verification.\nThis challenge is called a nonce (i.e. a number only used once).\nFuzzy? Let‚Äôs get in the code to make it clearer:\nfunc main() { // ... nonce := verifier.MakeNonce() presentation, err := subject.SignPresentation(credentials, nonce) } func (s Subject) SignPresentation(credentials Credential, nonce []byte) ( Presentation, error) { presentation := Presentation{ Context: vcContext, TypeOfPresentation: []string{presType}, Credential: credentials, Nonce: nonce, } presentation.Proof = SignProof(s.keys, presentation.ToBytes()) return presentation, err }  Presentation we get as output:\n{ \u0026quot;context\u0026quot;: [ \u0026quot;https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1\u0026quot; ], \u0026quot;type\u0026quot;: [ \u0026quot;VerifiablePresentation\u0026quot; ], \u0026quot;credential\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;context\u0026quot;: [ \u0026quot;https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1\u0026quot; ], \u0026quot;type\u0026quot;: [ \u0026quot;GraduationCredential\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;VerifiableCredential\u0026quot; ], \u0026quot;issuer\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;ID\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;https://oxford.com/issuers/1\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Name\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;The Marvelous University of Oxford\u0026quot; }, \u0026quot;issuanceDate\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;2022-01-11T16:49:46.424839+01:00\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;credentialSubject\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;id\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;CmwdBhPLKTvX8EeaUFnRsHJ/UXspbvU4o3DDPnRK8Ws=\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;claim\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;age\u0026quot;: 24, \u0026quot;universityName\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;Oxford\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;degree\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;Bachelor of Science\u0026quot; } }, \u0026quot;proof\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;type\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;Ed25519Signature2018\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;created\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;2022-01-11T16:49:46.425012+01:00\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;creator\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;i+HjQgi8ln5OEXuFKtaW0A1LwJo6o95tcKv+dtGFw/I=\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;signature\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;P0HOyLzkYD65KPxLrKF0jHzuLkhzHGFj1+6MnEa9329uaE88v0Pp1uB7KR+SONwE5pBq6ZMGgfwScWb0SIQ5Dg==\u0026quot; } }, \u0026quot;nonce\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;Uv38ByGCZU8WP18P\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;proof\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;type\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;Ed25519Signature2018\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;created\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;2022-01-11T16:49:46.425128+01:00\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;creator\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;CmwdBhPLKTvX8EeaUFnRsHJ/UXspbvU4o3DDPnRK8Ws=\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;signature\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;raseJvdviujKjsDGCV9A+K7o4zaMW2rqGpihXZKBqNdQvNhFgWnA5jsc1wjJ4ZQdC7I/GBRA9NBzAm7EwIT2Ag==\u0026quot; } }  Part III: The Verification The verifier has three things to check in the presentation above:\n The proof is signed by the subject of the credential (and the nonce is correct). The credential is correctly signed by the issuer. The presentation is correctly signed by the subject.  The first check is easily done: Are the proof.created and credential.credentialSubject.id equal?\nThe two others verifies that the signature matches the public key and the content the proof is about (the credential or the presentation).\nfunc verifiesSignature(proof Proof, signedDoc []byte) bool { pubKey := proof.Creator signature := proof.Signature return ed25519.Verify(pubKey, signedDoc, signature) } func (v Verifier) VerifiesPresentation(presentation Presentation) (err error) { // 1 - Checks the Presentation is signed by the Subject of the credential credential := presentation.Credential credentialSubjectID := credential.CredentialSubject.ID presentationProver := presentation.Proof.Creator if bytes.Compare(credentialSubjectID, presentationProver) != 0 { return fmt.Errorf(\u0026quot;Presentation prover is not the credential subject.\u0026quot;) } // 2 - Checks the credential okCred := verifiesSignature(credential.Proof, credential.ToBytes()) if !okCred { return fmt.Errorf(\u0026quot;Invalid credential signature.\u0026quot;) } // 3 - Checks the presentation okPres := verifiesSignature(presentation.Proof, presentation.ToBytes()) if !okPres { return fmt.Errorf(\u0026quot;Invalid presentation signature.\u0026quot;) } return err }  Conclusion ‚ÄúVCs are just signed JSON.‚Äù\nAlthough they are new, obscure and not currently common aren‚Äôt so scary once you get to play them.\nHope this was useful.\nValentin, signing off üñãÔ∏è\n","date":1644019200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1644019200,"objectID":"453ef988a5383217f4c8fa71f021b152","permalink":"/post/vc/","publishdate":"2022-02-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/vc/","section":"post","summary":" Verifiable credentials (VCs) are the translation of physical credentials like a driving license or a degree in the digital world.\nIn practice, it means we are just signed JSON.

That it will change the world? Or that it will make you rich?\nThey are not the same thing.\nBitcoin is the first internet-native way to speculate.\nThe technology could become omnipresent while the first crypto-currency becomes irrelevant.\nTo succeed a technology needs more than a vertical chart.\nTo drive widespread adoption, a technology needs to be useful, to solve a problem.\n A car has a clear benefit. You move. Fast. Steam enabled mechanization of production. With internet I can communicate with anyone, anywhere.  What can I do with a Bitcoin?\nI first heard of the blockchain in 2013. Until this summer (2021), I didn‚Äôt believe it had any chance of becoming useful.\nSiding out central banks may be exciting for hard core libertarian. But it‚Äôs not going to cut it for most people.\nThe true reason 300 millions people invested in cryptos isn‚Äôt the ideology.\nIt‚Äôs the quick buck üí∏\nNo one can deny that Bitcoin failed on its initial promise. It did not become a ‚Äúcoin‚Äù, an internet-native currency.\nAs all good marketers do, the fanboys changed the claim.\n‚ÄúOh it was never about making a currency. Bitcoin is a store of value. An internet-native gold.‚Äù\nExcept gold doesn‚Äôt lose 50% of its value every other week.\n(Source: Aswath Damodaran. Bitcoin didn‚Äôt achieve gold stability.)\n‚õ∞Ô∏è¬†The Tipping Point Still. All the media noise around NFTs and Web3 tipped me over.\nAfter looking into it, I finally believed there may be something to this chain of block thing.\nWhat‚Äôs so special about it?\nLet‚Äôs start with NFTs and come back to Web3 later.\nAt first, you could say NFTs just pulled the same trick as crypto-currencies: Being another channel for rollercoaster speculation.\nBut let‚Äôs go deeper.\nNFTs have the potential to support the creator economy (artists, writers, podcasters, youtubers\u0026hellip;).\nAnd more than enabling the purchase of their creation, an NFT could give its holder rights.\nWhere Bitcoin is blocked into being a commodity, NFTs have unlimited flexibility in the rights they can give.\nAn NFT could represent the right to meet its creator in 1-1s, or the right to attend his events (i.e., tickets), or the right to vote/participate in the next creation.\nI admit it is still fuzzy what the ownership of an NFT could represent, but this flexibility opens the door to USEFULNESS.\nFor example, Sorare uses NFTs to create a collectible card game where cards are tradeable.\nüéà¬†Bubble Economy At the moment, the area is awash with capital. All sorts of projects get funded.\nIf you look at any of the major technology developments in the past, there has always been a frenzy of funding at first.\nBe it in the steam age, the railways, or in IT, at the start, there is a bubble.\n(From ‚ÄúTechnological Revolution and Financial Capital‚Äù by Carlota Perez.)\nThe dawn of AI was predicted in the 1970s but only happened in 2010.\n Even crypto experts agree there is no doubt there is a bubble around crypto-assets.\nPeople telling you with 100% certainty that blockchain is the future are lying. Either to you or to themselves.\nWe can only be certain of the blockchain usefulness once it is widely adopted.\nFor now, we are at the start and we can only hope to catch a glimpse of the future.\n/rant_end\nüëÄ¬†The Glimpse NFTs were the appetizer.\nIt‚Äôs the main course that converted me: Web3.\n ‚ÄùWeb3 is the internet owned by the builders and users, orchestrated with tokens.‚Äù ‚Äî Chris Dixon\n To me, the magic happens at the ‚Äúorchestrated with token‚Äù.\n Orchestrated means governed or administrated. A token is a right. (As with NFTs, since they are also token, only non-fungible.)  Blurry. But this opens the door for a new kind of social organization.\nFor now this takes the form of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAO) .\nFor example, last November, ConstitutionDAO was formed in a few days to buy one of the 13 original United States Constitution copies.\nThey raised $43 millions from 17,437 contributors in 72h.\nBut Kickstarter could have done the same, no?\nThey have the technology to do so. But a single project never even raised half this amount.\nWhy?\nTRUST.\n ‚ÄùTrust minimization is reducing the vulnerability of participants to each other‚Äôs and to outsiders‚Äô and intermediaries potential for harmful behavior.‚Äù ‚Äî Nick Szabo\n From the beginning the main strength of the protocol invented by Satoshi Nakamoto is the little to no trust you need to have trust in the other participants to engage with it.\nYou don‚Äôt need to trust the people, the group or its leaders.\nYou just need to trust the code.\nIn my life I signed 1000s of contracts which I didn‚Äôt read. Because the contracts are just an insurance for worst case scenarios.\nIn truth, when you sign a contract you trust the people.\nWith a smart contract on the blockchain, it‚Äôs different. It defines the mode of interaction with this project.\nThe members of ConstitutionDAO knew their money could only be used to buy the constitution. They knew they‚Äôd be able to vote on what would be done with it afterwards.\nThe seller, Sotheby‚Äôs, knew it could trust this organization (which didn‚Äôt exist the week before) to afford its bid.\nUnlike usual contracts, you don‚Äôt even need to trust the State to enforce your contract.\nThe smart contract self-enforce. You don‚Äôt need to do anything for it to execute (and you couldn‚Äôt stop it if you wanted to).\nIn the real world, contracts are never self-enforced. You need lawyers. Which are\u0026hellip;\nNot free. Both in terms of money and time.\nTime is key.\nüë¨¬†What Humans Do Best Why do humans dominate all other species?\nOur cognitive capacity?\nYou may be ever so smart. But alone you are nothing.\nThe key difference: We are social. We make groups and coordinate.\nThese groups grow to towns, cities and nations.\n ‚ÄúWhy Nations Fail?‚Äù\nIn their book, Acemoglu and Robinson have a clear answer: Because nations don‚Äôt have inclusive enough institutions.\nPeople are not able to participate in their own governance.\nThis is not an article about democracy so I won‚Äôt expand much longer on this.\nAll our democracies and our social contracts did not evolve for nearly a century.\nThe law is too slow, too costly. We have a single vote between two different options every other year.\nThe world is too complex for this to be enough. We need a new way to interact with each other.\nTo take group decisions.\nFinding new modes of social organization is an even more important challenge than surviving climate change in my opinion.\nI think the blockchain is the technology that can enable the social innovations we need to level up human organizations.\nFast experiments are the enabler of discoveries.\nThe blockchain is the technology unlocking this speed by lowering the trust requirement for social organizations.\nI know this is only a glimpse üî≠\nBut it‚Äôs enough to get me excited in the field and speculate on its success.\nI speculate with the most valuable resource I have: time.\n ‚ÄúStrong opinions, loosely held.‚Äù ‚Äî Marc Andreessen\n If you disagree with any of the above, send me a mail at valentinmanes@outlook.fr to enrich our ideas.\nOtherwise, if you have a favorite resource you think I should start with, I‚Äôll gladly take any advice since the area is so wide and a bit overwhelming to enter in.\n","date":1640736000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1640736000,"objectID":"8af6fae93dca8e97f47ff404781ea6dd","permalink":"/post/cryptoskeptic/","publishdate":"2021-12-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/cryptoskeptic/","section":"post","summary":"Look inside: What‚Äôs the promise of the blockchain you believe in?

","tags":null,"title":"Ankou: Painful Creativity","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Introduction This is a summary of \u0026ldquo;How to Win Friends and Influence People\u0026rdquo; by Dale Carnegie. The goal of this book is obviously stated through its title üòú. Although at first sight, you might believe this is achieved by tricking others, actually the basic answer is very simple: just give your honest appreciation to others. See the world with their eyes, understand them, and sincerely try to help them.\n The principles taught in this book will work only when they come from the heart. I am not advocating a bag of tricks. I am talking about a new way of life.\n However, even though this is simple in principle, it is quite far from our first instinct. We tend to focus on ourselves, and me the first. So here I want to make a kind checklist from the book üìÉ. This way anyone can quickly go through it regularly and be sure to always have it fresh in their mind. I would still recommend reading the book if you haven\u0026rsquo;t done it yet. It will be easier to get in Carnegie\u0026rsquo;s mindset this way.\n The Fundamentals In this first part, Carnegie explains the base principles to apply. Then in the following parts, the author gives more specific and directly applicable advice.\n1. Never Criticize While criticizing, you run into the risk of turning people against yourself, for the improbable upside of getting them to do what you want. It rarely works and is very likely to backfire on you.\n2. Praise People  \u0026ldquo;I consider my ability to arouse enthusiasm among my people the greatest asset I possess, and the way to develop the best that is in a person is by appreciation and encouragement. [\u0026hellip;] I believe in giving incentives to work.\u0026rdquo; Charles Schwab\n For most people, a priority in life is to feel important. By providing them with this feeling, you give them a reason to do what you want. Just give them your honest appreciation for their own personnality or their action and they will feel their importance.\n3. Arouse an Eager Want No one cares about what you want. People care about their interests. To be able to influence others, you need to understand what matters to them. And once you identify their needs, show them how to get it. First, arouse an eager want, then show them how to obtain it.\nExample when in an apparent contradiction:\n Start positive. But \u0026hellip; describe the problem for them. Explain a solution for them.   Make People Love You Now let\u0026rsquo;s get into the more practical advice.\n1. Show Genuine Interest  A dog makes its living by giving nothing to you but love.\n Basically, just show genuine love to others. It can be in little things, like daily greetings. Do things for others, give them time, energy and thoughtfulness. Before you realize it, they will have given it back to you.\nCareful though: always be sincere.\n2. Smile  It costs nothing but creates much.\n  You must have a good time meeting people if you expect them to have a good time meeting you.\n 3. Call People by Name People place big importance on their own name. Remember it and call it easily.\n4. Be an Active Listener Everyone wants an opportunity to expand their ego. So give them an opportunity to do so by actively listening to them. Be interested: Ask questions, encourage them to talk.\nLetting people talk is a favor to them: it helps clarify their minds.\n5. Find and Talk about Their Interest  Talking in terms of the other person\u0026rsquo;s interest pays off for both parties.\n 6. Make Others Feel Important  Every man I meet is my superior in some way. In that, I learn of him.\n Honestly admire others. We all crave for importance. Give to others what you would like to be given ‚Üí To apply all the time!\n Change People Thinking 1. You Cannot Win an Argument  You can\u0026rsquo;t win an argument. If you lose it, you lose it; If you win it, you lose it.\n Arguing only creates resentment. The other person may do what you want, but they won\u0026rsquo;t do it with goodwill. They won\u0026rsquo;t change their way of thinking. Just never tell them they are wrong. At least partially agree with them. Make them feel good. Promise to consider their position. Show respect for their opinion.\n If you are going to prove anything, don\u0026rsquo;t let anybody know it. Do it subtly. [\u0026hellip;] With a few low-keyed suggestions at proper intervals, I let them develop my system themselves.\n 2. Willfully Admit when you are Wrong It is also quite likely that you are wrong. It happens surprisingly often. And when we catch ourselves, let\u0026rsquo;s admit it quickly and with enthusiasm. It will surprise others and put them in a non-fighting mindset. Astonishingly, we may get more from them this way.\n3. Begin Friendly At the start of the conversation or presentation, start in a \u0026ldquo;friendly mode\u0026rdquo;. It will put people in a positive mindset. They will be more inclined to see the good side of what you say.\n4. The \u0026ldquo;Yes, yes\u0026rdquo; Technique Famously used by Socrates: He often began conversation emphasizing the thing which he knew the other person will agree with. Seeking others agreement with a question, forces to commit to your side. It creates a good atmosphere and makes it easier for them to accept new ideas.\n5. Let Others Talk This will make sure you understand them. If you talk too much and do not give the others enough opportunity to express themselves, you might get into the wrong argument which may not matter to them. Just restrain yourself to an active listener position.\nEven better, if you are subtle enough to guide them in their talk, you can make suggestions and give them the feeling of ownership of ideas that you provide them. Once they feel it is their idea, they will become their strong supporter.\n6. Understand Others Point of View  Do not condemn them. Any fool can do that. Try to understand them.\n This is really the key to this book. Try to see things as others experience them. This is the best way to find how to change their mind.\n Cooperativeness in conversation is achieved when you show that you consider the other person\u0026rsquo;s ideas and feelings as important as your own.\n Everyone craves for the sympathy of other people. Be sympathetic to their ideas. Welcome them with an open mind.\n7. Appeal to Nobler Motives  \u0026ldquo;A person usually has two reasons for doing something: one that sounds good, and a real one\u0026rdquo; J.P. Morgan\n If you want to change people, appeal to their nobler motives. People are honest and fair, or at least they want to feel so.\n8. Dramatize, use Showmanship It makes your idea more vivid. It makes abstractions more concrete and thus easier to grasp. Numbers or concepts do not stick.\n9. Challenge People Carnegie advices using this when nothing else works. Stimulating competition, challenging people will drive their desire to excel. In the end, we are all motivated to do the best we can in the task we achieve.\n Being A Leader How to change people without offending them or causing resentment?\n1. Always Begin with Praise Only critic after you praise. You will set yourself as a friendly figure and thus your point will be received with a more positive mind.\n2. Praise the Slight Improvement Praise as the power to inspire people to go beyond what they thought they could do. The more you use this power, the more they will feel encouraged.\nBe specific in your praise. It shows the other you are really sincere. Your words are not empty, they have substance because you can precisely point what is praiseworthy.\n When criticism is minimized and praise emphasized, the good things people do will be reinforced, and the poorer things will atrophy for lack of attention.\n 3. Fake It Till They Make It If you show you believe someone has a virtue, state it openly, they will want to live up to the reputation you have given them! It will motivate them, give them a challenge.\nPlus, whenever they make mistakes, minimize it. Make it look like a small thing, like something easy to overcome. They may discover something they thought was hard, it actually easy for them once you give them the strength to go beyond their limits.\n4. Criticize Indirectly This one is harder to grasp. Basically, if you point mistakes directly, people may resent you. Instead, only suggest it indirectly. Make the other person understand your point by going around it. The danger is that you wander off too far from your target and that they do not see the point you critic at all.\nAn example from the book I found quite helpful: A guy wrote a speech and asks the opinion of his wife on it. The speech was quite bad because it would not flow well as a spoken performance. Instead of directly saying so, his wife said that it would make an excellent article. Praising it while making it clear that it would be a boring speech.\n5. Start by Stating Your Mistakes We have seen several starting tips so far. The way you start is important, it sets the mood. It can open or close the mind of the other person. So if you begin talking by criticizing yourself, you communicate to the other that you are a fair and humble person. You are not a distant boss too full of himself.\n It isn\u0026rsquo;t nearly so difficult to listen to a recital of your faults if the person criticizing begins by humbly admitting that he, too, is far from impeccable.\n 6. The Power of Suggestions No one likes to receive orders. So instead, try to only suggest a way of doing. Ask them questions that only hint at what you think would be a good way of proceeding. People will be much happier doing things if they feel it is their decision. Or at least that they are involved in the decision process.\nPlus, always try to understand what benefits them. Why would they be happy of following your suggestions? How would it benefit them? Sincerely try to match what would be a good outcome for them with what you want to be accomplished. This way, others may be happy of doing what you suggest.\n7. Let Others Save Face  I have no right to say or do anything that diminishes a man in his own eyes. What matters is not what I think of him, but what he thinks of himself. Hurting a man dignity is a crime.\u0026quot; Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry.\n If you destroy other people\u0026rsquo;s ego, they will always resent you and never follow you.\n Conclusion All these points are simple one by one. But all together they create a system of communication which doesn\u0026rsquo;t come easily. It\u0026rsquo;s important to practice it as much as possible. In all our interactions. And there are many recommendations, so it\u0026rsquo;s hard to keep them all in mind. So come back to this list regularly to refresh your mind üòâ.\n","date":1597881600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1597881600,"objectID":"8659d64810adb56868f62e26b379d612","permalink":"/post/carnegie/","publishdate":"2020-08-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/carnegie/","section":"post","summary":" This is a **checklist** of the advice given by Dale Carnegie in his famous book, 'How to Win Friends and Influence People'.

Once we know what will happen, we can prepare and take advantage of the situation and become stronger. For example, if you know which stock will go up/down, you would make a lot of money. The ability to predict is the foundation of science: experiment to find models that can forecast the future. Nassim Taleb destroyed this idea in his book \u0026ldquo;The Black Swan\u0026rdquo;: The most impactful events, the game changers, are unpredictable. Although we often use post-rationalization to make it look like we could have foreseen the events after the fact. For example, the 9/11¬†attack.\nIn \u0026ldquo;Antifragile: Things That Gain from Disorder\u0026rdquo;, Taleb explains what we can do when we cannot predict the future but know it will change everything big time. The answer is in the title: we should build antifragile system. We know there will be shocks. Instead of predicting these shocks themselves and lowering their consequences, we make systems that take advantage of them! Systems that get stronger thanks to the shocks.\nPersonal Impact Taleb directly speaks to me. While working doing research on Ankou and Entropic, I often confronted with this idea of how to deal with extremely rare events. In 2019, I got passionate about \u0026ldquo;Complex System\u0026rdquo; theory: system with so many inner interactions that their behavior cannot be well understood. I tried to read as much as possible on the subject: Geoffrey West, John Holland, Stuart Kauffman, and some others. I tried to understand \u0026ldquo;what can we do in this situation\u0026rdquo;.\nBasically, we cannot use the usual scientific approach of decomposing systems and then scaling up this understanding to predict the behavior of the whole system. Complex systems can only be characterized with high level statistical descriptors like entropy. We are limited to description, we cannot predict. And Taleb\u0026rsquo;s insight is a similar one: Complex systems, due to their many interactions have hidden, unforeseeable and non-linear behaviors. Their causal opacity and non-linearity make them perfect Black Swan generators. And guess what, almost everything we deal with nowadays is complex systems, are socio-economical system, most of the product we engineer (that\u0026rsquo;s why we can\u0026rsquo;t seem to solve all bugs), and of course nature itself.\nSolution We should stop trying to be smart. Stop trying to predict how systems are going to react to this or that shock. We should go back to our real goal: the payoff. Focus back on what we get in the end. If we put ourselves in an antifragile situation, we can benefit from future shocks, but we do not need to plan for them.\nThe Importance of Options  \u0026ldquo;Optionality is a substitute for intelligence.\u0026rdquo;\n  \u0026ldquo;The option is an agent of antifragility.\u0026rdquo;\n So how do we make ourselves antifragile? We give ourselves options. We often try to cut all which seems unnecessary, or redundant, to perform better at some given metric. But maybe this metric won\u0026rsquo;t be so important tomorrow. By having options, you give yourself more paths to explore in the future when you\u0026rsquo;ll get more information.\nTaleb likes to use the \u0026ldquo;rational fl√¢neur\u0026rdquo; metaphor: when you travel, instead of having a two week plan of how you\u0026rsquo;ll visit this city or this country, you just plan a few days forward. This way you have the freedom to plan the rest of the trip when you acquire more information while you are already there. You don\u0026rsquo;t know what kind of information you will acquire, you don\u0026rsquo;t know what unexpected event can occur. By keeping a maximum of options available, you make sure that whatever happens, you\u0026rsquo;ll be able to transform to your benefit.\nThis \u0026ldquo;option\u0026rdquo; solution can be reformulated in a \u0026lsquo;Trial and error\u0026rsquo; policy. All the things you can try are your options. Notice that you still need some rationality to try options that have some potential, and then recognize a successful trial. Taleb is saying that we rely too much on models and top-down logic, but not that science and formalization are never useful. We still need some. Just much less of it.\nAnd in the end, this is exactly the evolutionary heuristics we use for fuzzers! Each seed is an option the fuzzer has. The fitness function is the way we chose the potential \u0026ldquo;good options\u0026rdquo; for the future.\nVia Negativa  \u0026ldquo;Rule No. 1: Never lose money. Rule No. 2: Don‚Äôt forget rule No. 1\u0026rdquo; Warren¬†Buffet\n The other way Taleb suggests to achieve antifragility is to \u0026ldquo;remove the bad stuff\u0026rdquo;. It is not easy to predict what is going to happen, and it may be even harder to take advantage of it. However, it is often quite simple to detect fragility. The via negativa way is: detect the bad and remove it. This you are left with either robust, meaning that it does not have much reaction to shocks, negatively or positively, or antifragile.\n \u0026ldquo;We know a lot more about what is wrong than what is right. Negative knowledge is more robust to error than positive knowledge.\u0026rdquo;\n This is what he calls the \u0026ldquo;barbell\u0026rdquo; strategy. You have the robust part which you can\u0026rsquo;t lose; it is your insurance. And you have the antifragile part, which is riskier, but gives you exposure to different kinds of shocks by being diversified, and makes your profit/payoff. This is not very sophisticated, but in the end, less is more. This technique was lightly sketched out in \u0026ldquo;The Black Swan\u0026rdquo;, but without all of the fragility framework, so it was hard to understand why it would work.\nConclusion Do not be a fool. Do not over-optimize your system thinking you got everything under control. With a thin margin of safety, you risk losing it all. You are never fully safe from a Black Swan unless you set your system up this way.\n","date":1595116800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1595116800,"objectID":"d555a84c5e8ccdd48885f91b044dc389","permalink":"/post/antifragile/","publishdate":"2020-07-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/antifragile/","section":"post","summary":" We all want to **predict** the future.

Furthermore, its code was made the default schedule in LibFuzzer which powers Google\u0026rsquo;s OSSFuzz and Microsoft\u0026rsquo;s OneFuzz üöÄ.\n In this paper, we take the fundamental perspective of fuzzing as a learning process. Suppose before fuzzing, we know nothing about the behaviors of a program P: What does it do? Executing the first test input, we learn how P behaves for this input. Executing the next input, we either observe the same or discover a new behavior. As such, each execution reveals ‚Äúsome amount‚Äù of information about P‚Äôs behaviors. A classic measure of information is Shannon‚Äôs entropy. Measuring entropy allows us to quantify how much is learned from each generated test input about the behaviors of the program. Within a probabilistic model of fuzzing, we show how entropy also measures fuzzer efficiency. Specifically, it measures the general rate at which the fuzzer discovers new behaviors. Intuitively, efficient fuzzers maximize information.\nFrom this information theoretic perspective, we develop En- tropic, an entropy-based power schedule for greybox fuzzing which assigns more energy to seeds that maximize information. We implemented Entropic into the popular greybox fuzzer LibFuzzer. Our experiments with more than 250 open-source programs (60 million LoC) demonstrate a substantially improved efficiency and confirm our hypothesis that an efficient fuzzer maximizes informa- tion. Entropic has been independently evaluated and invited for integration into main-line LibFuzzer.

At a high level, fuzzing refers to a process of repeatedly running a program with generated inputs that may be syntactically or semantically malformed.\n Our survey shows the fuzzing community is extremely vibrant. The recent surge of work by researchers and practitioners alike has made it difficult to gain a comprehensive and coherent view of fuzzing. Thus, it is easy to lose track of the design decisions and potentially important tweaks performed in each tool and paper. Furthermore, there has been an observable fragmentation in the terminology used by various fuzzers. For example, test case \u0026ldquo;minimization\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;reduction\u0026rdquo; are often used interchangeably. Such fragmentation makes it difficult to discover and disseminate knowledge and may severely hinder the progress in fuzzing research in the long run.\nTo help preserve and bring coherence to the vast literature of fuzzing, this paper presented a unified, general-purpose model of fuzzing together with a taxonomy of the current literature. Our terminology is chosen to closely reflect the current predominant usages, and our model is designed to suit a large number of fuzzing tasks. We surveyed academic papers from the major Security and Software Engineering conferences in the last 10 years, as well as projects having more than 100 stars on GitHub. The paper methodically explores the design decisions at every stage of the model by surveying the related literature and innovations that make modern-day fuzzers effective.\nCompanion Website Our contribution in this work is more than just the survey.

It is backed by a repository at GitHub, which contains the genealogy and the classification data of the surveyed fuzzers in the JSON format.

I have trying to compile the kernel with clang ever since I have seen the LWN.net article on the topic. It says that you \u0026lsquo;just\u0026rsquo; need to go and compile your kernel with make CC=clang. So I went into the linux sources I had at this time (something around 4.9.60) and type the command. Obviously it didn\u0026rsquo;t work.\nTurns out, it\u0026rsquo;s not that much complicated. There are two requirements to compiling your kernel with clang:\n Get the right source and configuration. Get the right version of clang.  Everything is very well summarized on a LKML post from last November: https://lkml.org/lkml/2017/11/22/943.\nConcerning the source, I went for the simplest path: getting the latest stable version of the kernel with default configuration:\ngit clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-stable.git cd linux-stable git checkout v4.14.15 make defconfig  Here I\u0026rsquo;m on x86. If you want to compile for ARM64, it seems a bit more complicated. I didn\u0026rsquo;t try it but you might want to look for the android source that have not been upstreamed yet. Posting here because it\u0026rsquo;s not linked in the Matthias Kaehlcke\u0026rsquo;s LKML post:\n  https://android.googlesource.com/kernel/common.git/+log/android-4.9  https://android.googlesource.com/kernel/common.git/+log/android-4.4  There also other documentation made by Google here which shows how to compile the kernel with KASAN and KCOV. Didn\u0026rsquo;t dig into that but could be useful to someone.\nIf you are looking for other configuration than just the default one, I didn\u0026rsquo;t try that and I think it\u0026rsquo;s really and a case by case basis. You are going to have to dig a little bit more.\nAnd for the version of clang, you need clang 5 or more. I on Debian Stretch for which LLVM has precompiled binary (see here if you are on another OS version). So add them to your source list:\nsudo vim /etc/apt/sources.list  And then add:\ndeb http://apt.llvm.org/stretch/ llvm-toolchain-stretch-6.0 main deb-src http://apt.llvm.org/stretch/ llvm-toolchain-stretch-6.0 main  Now you can install clang:\nsudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install clang-6.0  If you are not on Debian/Ubuntu, I am not sure whether or not there is another solution than just compiling LLVM directly (see here).\nFinally, we have the source and the compiler, so we are ready to compile. Go in your linux-stable/ folder and:\nmake CC=clang-6.0 -j4 bzImage  I just wanted the bzImage to boot, but you remove it if you want to compile everything. -j4 because gain time by making compilation parallel\u0026hellip; Now I don\u0026rsquo;t know how you plan to use your clang compiled kernel, but just to check it\u0026rsquo;s usable, I run it with qemu:\nqemu-system-x86_64 -kernel arch/x86/boot/bzImage -nographic -serial mon:stdio -append 'console=ttyS0'  And since we didn\u0026rsquo;t provide the -initrd option, it will crash at the end with something like:\n---[ end Kernel panic - not syncing: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on unknown-block(0,0)  There are plenty of guides on how to use your kernel, not the goal here.\nThat will conclude my first post. Hopefully it was clear enough.

While monolithic kernel excels in performance and management, they are unequipped forruntime system update; and this brings the need for kernel extension. Although kernel extensions are a convenient measure for system management, it is well established that they make the system prone to rootkit attacks and kernel exploitation as they share the single memory space with the rest of the kernel. To address this problem, various forms of isolation (e.g., making into a process), are so far proposed, yet their performance overhead is often too high or incompatible for a general purpose kernel. In this paper, we propose Domain Isolated Kernel (DIKernel), a new kernel architecture which securely isolates the untrustedkernel extensions with minimal performance overhead. DIKernel leverages hardware-based memory domain feature in ARM architecture; and prevents system manipulation attacks originated from kernel extensions, such as rootkits and exploits caused by buggy kernel extensions. We implemented DIKernel on top of Linux 4.13 kernel with 1500 LOC.  Performance evaluation indicates that DIKernel imposes negligible overhead which is observed by cycle level microbenchmark.","tags":null,"title":"Domain Isolated Kernel: A lightweight sandbox for untrusted kernel extensions","type":"publication"}]
